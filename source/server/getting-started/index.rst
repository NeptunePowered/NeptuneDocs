Overview
========

What implementation should I pick?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Neptune provides two implementations of CanaryLib: NeptuneVanilla and NeptuneForge.
The decision really comes up to if you want to have client mods and/or Forge support.
If you want client mods or Forge support: pick NeptuneForge.
If you do not need any of that: pick NeptuneVanilla.
