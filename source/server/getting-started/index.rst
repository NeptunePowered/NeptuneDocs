What implementation should I pick?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are currently three implementations:

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Name", "Based on"

   "NeptuneForge", "Mojang's Minecraft and Minecraft Forge"
   "NeptuneVanilla", "Mojang's Minecraft"

The first option (NeptuneForge) allows the use of client mods that make use of Minecraft Forge.

It is often said that NeptuneVanilla is pointless when NeptuneForge exists, however there are many reasons to use NeptuneVanilla:

    * Performance concerns, as other options may use less memory and CPU to do the same task

All of our official implementations are built upon Minecraft and therefor share much code, and are usually both implemented to the same point.
